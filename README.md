# What is the Map of Life?

The Map of Life is a web application that integraties information about species distributions in an effort to support global understanding of the world's biodiversity. The resulting product will provide access to species distribution maps and a a set of tools for querying, accessing, downloading, and summarizing them. 

# Implementation

The application rides on the following projects:

1. [CartoDB](https://github.com/vizzuality/cartodb) - An open source tool for accessing and visualizing geospatial data on the web.
2. [Google Earth Engine](http://earthengine.google.org) - A parallel processing platform that surfaces algoritthms to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the earth's surface.
3. [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine) - A scalable application hosting service.

[1] Anything that is enumerated like this would be better in a list (e.g., BaseMap:1,2,3,4,5,6,7) --gtuco.btuco Mon Aug 08 2011 13:32:56 GMT-0700 (PDT)

WJ: Very right. OK.

[2] Could this be put together with Taxonomy Primary Year  and call the whole thing the Taxon Authority Citation?
 --gtuco.btuco Mon Aug 08 2011 12:49:30 GMT-0700 (PDT)

WJ: OK.
[3] If you want to use Darwin Core here, both start and end can go into one field, eventDate
 --gtuco.btuco Tue Aug 09 2011 07:52:03 GMT-0700 (PDT)

WJ: OK

[4] Can all of the Survey method information go into the samplingProtocol? Ideally that would be a URL to all of the detailed information from the contributor.
  --gtuco.btuco Tue Aug 09 2011 09:27:58 GMT-0700 (PDT)

WJ: AS much as possible should. We'll probably provide several categories to chose from.
[5] Lists might be good here too. --gtuco.btuco Mon Aug 08 2011 13:34:55 GMT-0700 (PDT).

WJ: OK.
[6] Actually, all three of the projection fields (and more) can be captured in a proj string such as
"+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext +over +no_defs"
  --gtuco.btuco Tue Aug 09 2011 07:47:48 GMT-0700 (PDT)

WJ: OK! Just need to make it easy to provide this info in UI.
[7] How meaningful is this if you don't know who says so and what criteria they are following?
 --gtuco.btuco Tue Aug 09 2011 09:20:53 GMT-0700 (PDT)

WJ: We'd provide instructions. Tricky, I know, but better than having no knowledge. We may down the road have another field(s) along these lines.

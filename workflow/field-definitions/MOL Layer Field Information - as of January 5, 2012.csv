The species is known or thought very likely to occur presently in the area, usually encompassing current or recent (post 1980) localities where suitable habitat at appropriate altitudes remains.
Probably Extant ? The species? presence is considered probable, either based on extrapolations of known records, or realistic inferences (e.g., based on distribution of suitable habitat at appropriate altitudes and proximity to areas where it is known or thought very likely to remain Extant). ?Probably Extant? ranges often extend beyond areas where the species is Extant, or may fall between them.
Possibly Extant: The species may possibly occur, and should be searched for, but there are no known records and less than probably occurrence. ?Possibly Extant? ranges often extend beyond areas where the species is Extant (q.v.) or Probably Extant (q.v.), or may fall between them.
Possibly Extinct ? The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area, but it is most likely now extirpated from the area because habitat loss/other threats are thought likely to have extirpated the species and/or owing to a lack of records in the last 30 years.
Extinct ? The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area, but there have been no records in the last 30 years and it is almost certain that the species no longer occurs, and/or habitat loss/other threats have almost certainly extirpated the species.
Presence Uncertain ? The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area but it is no longer known whether it still occurs (usually because there have been no recent surveys).
Notes:
1. These codes are mutually exclusive; a polygon coded as ?Extant? cannot also be coded as ?Extinct?.
2. To obtain the total historical range of a species, one would sum polygons for Extant, Probably Extant, Possibly Extinct, Extinct and Presence Uncertain, but not Possibly Extant."

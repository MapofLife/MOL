So here's how to get data (points or polygons) into CartoDB right now.

1.  Create a new, blank CartoDB table with the correct geometry (we currently
    support points and polygons).
2.  Rename the table. For this example, I will use the table name 'demo'.
3.  Delete the 'description' column from this table. This is necessary because
    the field specification defines its own 'description' column, and
    'add-cartodb-columns.py' does not delete existing columns.
4.  Run 'python add-cartodb-columns.py --table demo'. This script will now
    create columns in 'demo' based on the field specification, with appropriate
    data types where possible. If something gets messed up here, it's probably
    easiest to delete the 'demo' table from CartoDB and start over at step #1.
5.  Once the columns have been created, run:
        python loader.py --table demo [--source directory]
    This will load the data from the 

    At the moment, this is a very verbose output so you know exactly what is 
    being transmitted to the server. It is also very slow, partially because
    of all the print-ing, but also because each SQL statement is being
    individually transmitted to the server. A key next step will be to
    ensure that SQL statements are combined into single, large POST containing
    multiple SQL statements to be executed at once.
6.  That should be it! Check if the points or polygons are correctly uploaded.
